## GANDALFF: Golang, ANother DAta Library For Fun

Or Gdl: Golang Data Library

### What is it?

Gandalff is a library for data manipulation in Go. It is inspired by the R language and the dplyr package.
It supports nullable types: null data is optimized for memory usage.
`SeriesBool` stores the boolean data as bits, and `SeriesString` stores the string data in a string pool.

### Why?

The primary purpose of this library is to have an easy-to-use data manipulation library for Go and to be as close as possible to the R language and the Dplyr package.
It also has to be performant; hopefully, it will become as fast as Polars.

### Examples

```go
func Example01() {
	data := `
name,age,weight,junior,department,salary band
Alice C,29,75.0,F,HR,4
John Doe,30,80.5,true,IT,2
Bob,31,85.0,T,IT,4
Jane H,25,60.0,false,IT,4
Mary,28,70.0,false,IT,3
Oliver,32,90.0,true,HR,1
Ursula,27,65.0,f,Business,4
Charlie,33,60.0,t,Business,2
`

	NewBaseDataFrame().
		FromCSV().
		SetReader(strings.NewReader(data)).
		SetDelimiter(',').
		SetHeader(true).
		Read().
		Select("department", "age", "weight", "junior").
		GroupBy("department").
		Agg(Min("age"), Max("weight"), Mean("junior"), Count()).
		PrettyPrint()

	// Output:
	// +------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	// | department |        age |     weight |     junior |          n |
	// +------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	// |     String |    Float64 |    Float64 |    Float64 |      Int32 |
	// +------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	// |         HR |         29 |         90 |        0.5 |          2 |
	// |         IT |         25 |         85 |        0.5 |          4 |
	// |   Business |         27 |         65 |        0.5 |          2 |
	// +------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
}
```

### Implementation details

This is how the interface for the Series type currently looks like
with all the methods that are currently implemented.

```go
type Series interface {
	// Basic accessors.

	// Return the context of the series.
	GetContext() *Context
	// Return the number of elements in the series.
	Len() int
	// Return the type of the series.
	Type() typesys.BaseType
	// Return the type and cardinality of the series.
	TypeCard() typesys.BaseTypeCard
	// Return if the series is grouped.
	IsGrouped() bool
	// Return if the series admits null values.
	IsNullable() bool
	// Return if the series is sorted.
	IsSorted() SeriesSortOrder
	// Return if the series is error.
	IsError() bool
	// Return the error message of the series.
	GetError() string

	// Nullability operations.

	// Return if the series has null values.
	HasNull() bool
	// Return the number of null values in the series.
	NullCount() int
	// Return if the element at index i is null.
	IsNull(i int) bool
	// Return the null mask of the series.
	GetNullMask() []bool
	// Set the null mask of the series.
	SetNullMask(mask []bool) Series
	// Make the series nullable.
	MakeNullable() Series
	// Make the series non-nullable.
	MakeNonNullable() Series

	// Get the element at index i.
	Get(i int) any
	// Get the element at index i as a string.
	GetAsString(i int) string
	// Set the element at index i.
	Set(i int, v any) Series
	// Take the elements according to the given interval.
	Take(params ...int) Series

	// Append elements to the series.
	// Value can be a single value, slice of values,
	// a nullable value, a slice of nullable values or a series.
	Append(v any) Series

	// All-data accessors.

	// Return the actual data of the series.
	Data() any
	// Return the nullable data of the series.
	DataAsNullable() any
	// Return the data of the series as a slice of strings.
	DataAsString() []string

	// Cast the series to a given type.
	Cast(t typesys.BaseType) Series
	// Copie the series.
	Copy() Series

	// Series operations.

	// Filter out the elements by the given mask.
	// Mask can be a bool series, a slice of bools or a slice of ints.
	Filter(mask any) Series
	filterIntSlice(mask []int, check bool) Series

	// Apply the given function to each element of the series.

	// Group the elements in the series.
	group() Series
	GroupBy(gp SeriesPartition) Series
	UnGroup() Series

	// Sort Interface.
	Less(i, j int) bool
	equal(i, j int) bool
	Swap(i, j int)

	// Sort the elements of the series.
	Sort() Series
	SortRev() Series

	// Arithmetic operations.
	Mul(other Series) Series
