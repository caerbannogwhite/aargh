i mean
what's it all about
beats me
why are we here
what is life all about
is god really real
or is there some doubt
well tonight we're going to sort it all out
for tonight it's the meaning of life
what's the point of all these hoax
is it the chicken and egg time
are we all just yolks
or perhaps
we're just one of god's little jokes
well ca c'est the meaning of life
is life just a game where we make up the rules
while we're searching for something to say
or are we just simple spiralling coils
of self-replicating dna
what is life
what is our fate
is there heaven and hell
do we reincarnate
is mankind evolving or is it too late
well tonight here's the meaning of life
for millions this life is a sad vale of tears
sitting round with really nothing to say
while scientists say we're just simply spiralling coils
so just why
and just what
what
what do we fear
well ce soir
for a change
it will all be made clear
for this is the meaning of life
c'est le sens de la vie -
this is the meaning of life

hospital

administrator
gentlemen
morning mr pycroft
very impressive
what are you doing this morning
it's a birth
and what sort of thing is that
well
that's when we take a new baby out of a lady's
tummy
wonderful what we can do nowadays
i see you
have the machine that goes 'ping'
this is my favourite
you
see we lease this back to the company we sold it to
that
way it comes under the monthly current budget and not the
capital account
thank you
we
try to do our best
do carry on

that you suffer for some time a totally irrational feeling of
depression

i've got something to tell the whole family

go and get the others in
gordon
the mill's closed
there's no more work
we're destitute
i've got no option but to sell you all for scientific
experiments
no no
that's the way it is my loves
blame the catholic
church for not letting me wear one of those little rubber
things
oh they've done some wonderful things in their time
they preserved the might and majesty
even the mystery of the
church of rome
the sanctity of the sacrament and the
indivisible oneness of the trinity
but if they'd let me wear
one of the little rubber things on the end of my cock we
wouldn't be in the mess we are now
little boy
couldn't mummy have worn some sort of pessary
not if we're going to remain members of the fastest growing
religion in the world
my boy
we believe
let me put it like this
there are jews in the world
there are buddhists
there are hindus and mormons and then
there are those that follow mohammed
but i've never been one of them
i'm a roman catholic
and have been since before i was born
and the one thing they say about catholics
is they'll take you as soon as you're warm
you don't have to be a six-footer
you don't have to have a great brain
you don't have to have any clothes on -
you're a catholic the minute dad came
because
every sperm is sacred
every sperm is great
if a sperm is wasted
god gets quite irate
child
let the heathen spill theirs
on the dusty ground
god shall make them pay for
each sperm that can't be found
every sperm is wanted
every sperm is good
every sperm is needed
in your neighbourhood
hindu
taoist
mormon
spill theirs just anywhere
but god loves those who treat their
semen with more care
men neighbours
women neighbours
god get quite irate
priest
bride and groom
nannies
cardinals
every sperm is useful
every sperm is fine
funeral cortege
god needs everybody's
first mourner
mine
lady mourner
and mine
corpse
nun
though the pagans spill theirs
o'er mountain
hill and plain
various artefacts in a roman catholic souvenir shop
god shall strike them down for
each sperm that's spilt in vain
everybody
even more than everybody
including two fire-eaters
a juggler
a
clown at a piano and a stilt-walker riding a bicycle
so you see my problem
little ones
i can't keep you here
any longer
shout from the back
speak up
i can't keep you here any longer
god
has blessed us so much that i can't afford to feed you
anymore
boy
couldn't you have your balls cut off
it's not as simple as that nigel
god knows all
he would
see through such a cheap trick
what we do to ourselves
we do
to him
voice
you could have them pulled off in an accident
no
i know you're trying to help but
believe me
my mind's made up
i've given this long and
careful thought
and it's medical experiments for the lot of
mr blackitt
look at them
bloody catholics
filling the bloody
world up with bloody people they can't afford to bloody feed
mrs blackitt
what are we dear
protestant
and fiercely proud of it
why do they have so many children
because every time they have sexual intercourse they
have to have a baby
but it's the same with us
harry
what d'you mean
well i mean we've got two children and we've had
sexual intercourse twice
that's not the point
we could have it any time we
wanted
really
oh yes
what's more
because we don't believe in
all that papist claptrap we can take precautions
you mean lock the door
because we are members of the
protestant reformed church which successfully challenged the
autocratic power of the papacy in the mid-sixteenth century
we can wear little rubber devices to prevent issue
what do you mean
i could
if i wanted
have sexual intercourse with
and by wearing a rubber sheath over my old feller i
could ensure that when i came off
you would not be
impregnated
ooh
that's what being a protestant's all about
that's
why it's the church for me
that's why it's the church for
anyone who respects the individual and the individual's right
to decide for him or herself
when martin luther nailed his
protest up to the church door in 1517
he may not have
realised the full significance of what he was doing
but four
hundred years later
thanks to him
my dear
i can wear
whatever i want on my john thomas
and protestantism doesn't
stop at the simple condom
oh no
i can wear french ticklers
if i want
you what
french ticklers
black mambos
crocodile ribs
sheaths that are designed not only to protect but also to
enhance the stimulation of sexual congress
have you got one
have i got one
well no
but i can go down the road
any time i want and walk into harry's and hold my head up
high
and say in a loud steady voice
'harry i want you to
sell me a condom
in fact today i think i'll have a french
tickler
for i am a protestant
'
well why don't you
but they
they cannot
because their church
never made the great leap out of the middle ages
and the
domination of alien episcopal supremacy
the adventures of
martin
luther
reform-o-scope
presented by
the protestant film marketing board
in association with
sol
c
ziegler
andy rotbeiner
and the people of beirut
germany
in the grip of the 16th century
an exciting and controversial examination of the protestant
reformer whose re-assessment of the role of the individual in
christian belief shook the foundations of a post-feudal germany in
the grip of the sixteenth century
it was a day much like any other in the quiet little town of
wittenberg
mamie meyer was preparing fat for the evening meal when
the full force of the reformation struck
hymie
mamie
martin luther's out
martin luther
did you get the suet
oy vay
the suet i clean forgot
the suet you forgot
the lard
the fish oil
the butter fat
the dripping
the
wool grease i remember
but the
suet
so what'd keep up there
adipose
tissue
look out
here he comes
girls
your father forgot the suet
hallo martin
where's the john
we don't have one
no john
what d'you do
we eat fat
and that stops you going to the john
it's a theory
but does it work
we ain't got no john
but d'you need to go
you know how it is with theories
some days it's fine
maybe one
two
three days
and then just when it looks
like you're ready for to publish
whoosh
you need a new kitchen floor
oh you should be so lucky
d'you need any cleaning inside
today it's all going fine
oh well
how's about showing me the cutlery
i got a woman and children in there
so there's no problem
i just look at a few
spoons
i got two girls in there
you know what i mean
honest
i don't look at your girls
i don't even
think about them
there
i put them out of my mind
their
arms
their necks
their little legs
and bosoms
i
wipe from my mind
you just want to see spoons
my life
that's what i want to see
i know i'm going to regret this
listen
cutlery is really my thing now
with round breasts is over for me
what am i doing
i know what's going to happen
i'll crouch behind you
guess who's come to see us
are you out of your mind already
you know how old
your daughters are
he only wants to see the spoons
what you have to bring him into my house for
he doesn't even think about girls any more
mrs meyer
as far as girls is concerned
i shot my
wad
you shot your wad
def
ately
which spoons you wanna view
eh
i guess the soup spoons
now they're good spoons
you got them arranged
but i could arrange them for you
don't put yourself to no bother
it's no bother
i want for you to see those spoons like i
would want to see them myself
oh you're too kind
you could get your
daughters to show me them
hymie get him out of here
he only said for myrtle and audrey to show him the
like you think i run some kind of bordello here
how can you say such a thing
listen martin luther
i know what you want to do with my
show me the spoons
you want for them to pull up their shirts and then lean over
the chair with their legs apart
mamie don't get excited
i'm getting excited
it's him that's getting excited
my mind is on the spoons
but you can't stop thinking of those little girls over the
chairs
i got to go to the bathroom
i'm a married woman
so
just show him the spoons
and you don't want to put nothing up me
you read my mind
but despite the efforts of protestants to promote the idea of sex
for pleasure
children continued to multiply everywhere
part ii
growth and learning
headmaster
and spotteth twice they the camels before the third
hour
and so the midianites went forth to ram gilead in kadesh
bilgemath by shor ethra regalion
to the house of
gash-bil-betheul-bazda
he who brought the butter dish to
balshazar and the tent peg to the house of rashomon
and there
slew they the goats
yea
and placed they the bits in little
pots
here endeth the lesson
chaplain
let us praise god
oh lord
congregation
oooh you are so big
so absolutely huge
so ab
solutely huge
gosh
we're all really impressed down here i can tell
forgive us
o lord
for this dreadful toadying
and barefaced flattery
but you are so strong and
just so super
fan
tastic
amen
now two boys have been found rubbing linseed oil
into the school cormorant
now some of you may feel that the
cormorant does not play an important part in the life of the
school but i remind you that it was presented to us by the
corporation of the town of sudbury to commemorate empire day
when we try to remember the names of all those from the
sudbury area so gallantly gave their lives to keep china
british
so from now on the cormorant is strictly out of
bounds
and jenkins
apparently your mother died this
chaplain and congregation
please don't burn us
don't grill or toast your flock
don't put us on the barbecue
or simmer us in stock
don't braise or bake or boil us
or stir-fry us in a wok
oh please don't lightly poach us
or baste us with hot fat
don't fricassee or roast us
or boil us in a vat
and please don't stick thy servants lord
in a rotissomat
he's coming
settle down
now before i begin the lesson will those of you
who are playing in the match this afternoon move your clothes
down on to the lower peg immediately after lunch before you
write your letter home
if you're not getting your hair cut
unless you've got a younger brother who is going out this
weekend as the guest of another boy
in which case collect his
note before lunch
put it in your letter after you've had your
hair cut
and make sure he moves your clothes down onto the
lower peg for you
wymer
sir
my younger brother's going out with dibble this weekend
but i'm not having my hair cut today sir
so do i move my
clothes down or
i do wish you'd listen
it's perfectly simple
you don't have to move
your brother's clothes down to the lower peg
you simply
collect his note before lunch after you've done your scripture
prep when you've written your letter home before rest
move
your own clothes on to the lower peg
greet the visitors
report to mr viney that you've had your chit signed
sex
where were we
had i got as far as the penis entering the vagina
pupils
er
no sir
no we didn't
well had i done foreplay
yes sir
as we all know about foreplay no doubt you can
tell me what the purpose of foreplay is
biggs
don't know
sorry sir
carter
was it taking your clothes off
and after that
putting them on the lower peg sir
the purpose of foreplay is to cause the vagina to
lubricate so that the penis can penetrate more easily
watson
could we have a window open please sir
harris will you
of course
to cause the
man's penis to erect and har
den
did i do vaginal
juices last week oh do pay attention wadsworth
i know it's
friday afternoon oh watching the football are you boy
move over there
i'm warning you i may decide to set an
exam this term
oh sir
so just listen
now did i or did i not do vaginal
juices
name two ways of getting them flowing
rubbing the clitoris
what's wrong with a kiss
hm
why not start her
off with a nice kiss
you don't have to go leaping straight
for the clitoris like a bull at a gate
give her a kiss
suck the nipple
well done
duckworth
stroking the thighs
i suppose so
another
bite the neck
nibbling the ear
kneading the buttocks
and so
on and so forth
so we have all these possibilities before we
stampede towards the clitoris
all these form of stimulation can now take place
and of course tongueing will give you the best idea of how
the juices are coming along
helen
now penetration
and coitus
that is to say intercourse up to and including
orgasm
ah hallo
dear
do stand up when my wife enters the room
oh sorry
sorry
mrs williams
humphrey
i hope you don't mind
but i told the
garfields we would dine with them tonight
i suppose we must
i said we'd be there by
eight
well at least it'll give me a reason to wind up the
staff meeting
well i know you don't like them but i couldn't make
another excuse
well it's just that i felt -
this is for your benefit
will you kindly wake up
i've
no intention of going through this all again
now we'll
take the foreplay as read
if you don't mind
no of course not
so the man starts by entering
or mounting his good
lady wife in the standard way
the penis is now as you will
observe more or less fully erect
there we are
ah that's
better
what is it
it's an ocarina
bring it up here
the man now starts making thrusting
movements with his pelvic area
moving the penis up and down
inside the vagina so
put it there boy
put it there
on
the table
while the wife maximizes her clitoral stimulation
by the shaft of the penis by pushing forward
now as sexual excitement mounts
what's funny biggs
nothing sir
oh do please share your little joke with the rest of
us
obviously something frightfully funny's going
honestly
well as it's so funny i think you'd better be selected
to play for the boys' team in the rugby match against the
masters this afternoon
part iii
fighting each other
o
k
blackitt
sturridge and
walters you take the buggers on the left flank
hordern
spadger and i will go for the gunpost

let us come with you
do as you're told man
righto
skipper
if we
if we don't meet again

to say it's been a real privilege fighting alongside you

goodbye speech
and the lads realise that but
we may
never meet again
thanks a lot
no just a mo
you see me and the lads had a little
whip-round
and we bought you something
we bought

thank you all
but i think we'd better
get
to cover now
hang on a tick
we got something else for you as
sorry it's another clock
only there was a bit of a
mix-up
walters thought he was buying the present
spadger and i had already got the other one
well it's beautiful
they're both beau -
but i think we'd better get to cover now
and i'll thank
you properly later
and corporal sturridge got this for you as well
he
didn't know about the others
it's swiss
well now that is thoughtful
sturridge
good man

three cheers for captain biggs
hip hip -

hooray
hoor
i'll be all right
oh there's just one
other thing
spadge

spadger
oh yeah
oh now this is really going to far
i don't seem to be able to find it
it'll be in number four trench
i'll go and get it
for christ's sake forget it
you shouldn't have said that
you've hurt his
feelings now
don't mind me
toffs is all the same
one
minute it's all 'please' and 'thank you'
the next they'll
kick you in the teeth
walters
let's not give him the cake
i don't want any cake
blackitt cooked it specially for you
you bastard
he saved his rations for six weeks
i don't mean to be ungrateful
blackie
look at him
he worked on that cake like no-one else i've ever
known
some nights it was so
cold we could hardly move
but blackie'd de out there -
slicing lemons
mixing the sugar and the almonds
i mean you
try getting butter melted at fifteen below zero
there's love
in that cake
this man's love
and this man's care and this man's
aarggh
oh my christ
we will eat the cake
they're right
it's too good a cake not to eat
get the plates and knives
how many plates
six
better make it five
tablecloth
get the tablecloth
no no no
i'll get the tablecloth and you'd better get the
gate-leg table
i'll bring two sir
in case one gets scrumpled
general
warfare isn't all fun
stop that
it's all very well to laugh at the military
but when one
considers the meaning of life it is a struggle between
alternative viewpoints of life itself
and without the
ability to defend one's own viewpoint against other perhaps
more aggressive ideologies then reasonableness and moderation
could quite simply disappear
that is why we'll always need an
army and may god strike me down were it to be otherwise
rsm
don't stand there gawping like you've never seen the hand of
god before
today we're going to do marching up and down
the square
that is unless any of you got anything better to
do
anyone got anything they'd rather be doing than
marching up and down the square
atkinson
what would you rather be doing
well to be quite honest
sarge
i'd rather be at home
with the wife and kids
would you now
right off you go
everybody else happy
with my little plan of marching up and down the square a bit
coles
i've got a book i'd quite like to read
you go read your book then
everybody else quite content to join in with my little scheme
of marching hup and down the square
wycliff
i'm
learning the piano
'learning the piano'
and i suppose you want to go and practise eh
marching up and
down the square not good enough for you
off you go
now what about the
rest of you
rather be at the pictures i suppose
ooh rather
all right off you go
bloody army
i don't know
what it's coming to
sgt major
marching up and down

democracy and humanitarianism have always been tarde marks of the
british army and have stamped its triumph throughout history
the furthest-flung corners of the empire
but no matter where or
when there was fighting to be done
it has always been the calm
leadership of the officer class that has made the british army what
it is
the first zulu war
natal 1879
pakenham-walsh
morning ainsworth
ainsworth
morning pakenham-walsh
sleep well
not bad
bitten to shreds though
must be a hole in the
bloody mosquito net
savage little blighters aren't they
first lieut chadwick
excuse me
yes chadwick
chadwick
i'm afraid perkins got rather badly bitten during the
night
well so did we
huh
but i do think the doctor ought to see him
well go and fetch him
then
right you are
suppose i'd better go along
coming
pakenham
yes i suppose so
morning perkins
perkins
morning sir
what's all the trouble then
bitten sir
during the night
whole leg gone eh
how's it feel
stings a bit
mmm
well it would
wouldn't it
that's quite a bite
you've got there you know
real beauty isn't it
any idea how it happened
none at all
complete mystery to me
woke up just now
one sock too many
you must have a hell of a hole in your net
we've sent for the doctor
hardly worth it
is it
better safe than sorry
good lord
look at this
by jove
that's enormous
you don't think it'll come back
do you
for more
you mean
you're right
we'd better get this stitched
hallo doc
livingstone
i came as
fast as i could
is something up
during the night old perkins had his leg bitten
sort of
off
ah hah
been in the wars have we
any headache
bowels all right
let's have a
look at this one leg of yours then
this is
nothing to worry about
oh good
there's a lot of it about
probably a virus
keep
warm
plenty of rest
and if you're playing football or
anything try and favour the other leg
oh right ho
be as right as rain in a couple of days
thanks for the reassurance
doc
not at all
that's what i'm here for
any other
problems i can reassure you about
no i'm fine
must be off
so it'll just grow back then
will it
i think i'd better come clean with you about
this
it's
um it's not a virus
i'm afraid
virus is what we doctors call very very small
so small it
could not possibly have made off with a whole leg
what we're
looking for here is i think
and this is no more than an
educated guess
i'd like to make that clear
is some
multi-cellular life form with stripes
huge razor-sharp teeth
about eleven foot long and of the genu felis horribilis
what we doctors
in fact
call a tiger
all in tent
a tiger
in africa
a tiger in africa
well it's probably escaped from a zoo
well it doesn't sound very likely
stumm
sergeant
the attack's over
the zulus are
retreating
oh jolly good
quite a lot of casualties though
c division wiped
out
signals gone
thirty men killed in f section
i should
think about a hundred
a hundred and fifty men altogether
yes i see
i haven't got the final figures
there's a lot of
seriously wounded in the compound
the thing is
got a bit of a problem here
one of the
officers has lost a leg
i'm afraid so
probably a tiger
ainsworth and pakenham-walsh
the m
says we can stitch it back on if we find it
immediately
right sir
i'll organise a party right away
well it's hardly time for that
is it sergeant
a search party
much better idea
i'll tell you what
organise one
straight away
sorry about the mess
we'll try and
get it cleared up
by the time you get back
a dying man
we showed 'em
didn't we
we've got to get a search party
leave that alone
another cheery cockney
this is fun
init
all this killing
bloodshed
bloody good fun sir
very good
a severed head
nasty wound you've got there
potter
severed head
thank you very much sir
come on private
we're making up a search party
another terrible casualty
better than staying at home
eh sir
at
home if you kill someone they arrest you
here they give you
a gun
and show you what to do
i killed fifteen
of those buggers sir
now at home they'd hang me
here they
give me a fucking medal sir
my god
it's huge
rear end
don't shoot
we're not a tiger
we were just
um
why are you dressed as a tiger
hmmm
why
why why
isn't it a lovely day
today
answer the question
oh we were just er
front end
actually
we're dressed like this because
that's not it
we did it for a lark
part of a spree
high spirits you
know
simple as that
nothing more to it
well actually
we're on a mission for british
intellingence
there's a pro-tsarist ashanti chief
no we're doing it for an advertisement
ah that's it
forget about the russians
we're doing an
advert for tiger brand coffee
'tiger brand coffee is a real treat
even tigers prefer a cup of it to real meat'
now look
we are dressed as a tiger because
he had an auntie who did it in 1839 and this is the fiftieth
anniversary
we're doing it for a bet
god told us to do it
to tell the truth
we are completely mad
we are inmates
of a bengali psychiatric institution and we escaped by making
this skin out of old cereal packets
it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter why they're dressed as a tiger
have
they got my leg
good thinking
well have you
it's because we were thinking of training as taxidermists
and we wanted to get a feel of it from the animal's point of
view
be quiet
look we're just asking you if you have
got this man's leg
a wooden leg
a proper leg
look he was fast asleep and
someone or something came in and removed it
without waking him up
i don't believe you
we found the tiger skin in a bicycle shop in cairo
the owner wanted to take it down to dar es salaam
shut up
have you or have you not got his leg
both
no no no no no no
nope
why did you say 'yes'
i didn't
i'm not talking to you
search the thicket
oh come on
i mean do we look like the sort of chaps
who'd creep into a camp at
steal into someone's
tent
anaesthetise them
tissue-type them
amputate a leg and
run away with it
oh leg
you're looking for a leg
actually i think
there is one in there somewhere
somebody must have abandoned
it here
knowing you were coming after it
and we stumbled
across it actually and wondered what it was
they'll be
miles away by now and i expect we'll have to take all the
blame
zulu announcer
good evening and welcome to the middle of
the film
lady tv presenter
hallo and welcome to the middle of the film
moment where we take a break and invite you
the audience
to
join us
the film-makers
in 'find the fish'
we're going to
show you a scene from another film and ask you to guess where
the fish is
but if you think you know
don't keep it to
yourselves
yell out
so that all the cinema can hear you
so here we are with 'find the fish'
middle
of the film
find the fish
i wonder where that fish has gone
woman
you did love it so
you looked after it like a son
and it went wherever i did go
is it in the cupboard
audience
wouldn't you like to know
it was a lovely little fish
man in audience
it's behind the sofa
where can the fish be
have you thought of the drawers in the bureau
it is a most elusive fish
oh fishy
fishy
fish
fishy oh
fishy fish
that went wherever i did go
that was terrific
great
best bit so far
fishes
absolutely
terrific
fantastic
really great
they haven't said much about the meaning of life so
far
have they
it's been building up to it
has it
i expect they'll get on to it now
personally i very much doubt if they're going to say
anything about the meaning of life at all
they've got to say something
other fishes
bound to
not much happening at the moment
is there
part iv
middle age

'super inn skins'
that's nice
waiter
good evening
would you care for something to talk about
oh that would be wonderful
our special tonight is minorities
oh that sounds interesting
what's this conversation here
oh that's football
you can talk about the steelers-bears
game
saturday
or you could reminisce about really great
world series
what's this one here
that's philosophy
is that a sport
no it's more of an attempt to construct a viable hypothesis
to explain the meaning of life
what's he say
oh that sounds wonderful
would you like to talk about
darling
sure
philosophy for two
you folks want me to start you off
oh really we'd appreciate that
well er
have you ever wondered just why you're
here
we went to miami last year and california the
year before that
and we've
i mean why we're here
on this planet
n
have you ever wanted to know what it's all about
right ho
see
throughout history there have been
certain men and women who have tried to find the solution to
the mysteries of existence
and we call these guys 'philosophers'
and that's what we're talking about
that's neat
well you look like you're getting the idea
so why don't i
give you these conversation cards
they'll tell you a little
about philosophical method
names of famous philosophers
there y'are
have a nice conversation
thank you very much
he's cute
real understanding
i never knew that schopenhauer was a
philosopher
he's the one that begins with an s
like nietzsche
does nietzsche begin with an s
there's an s in nietzsche
oh wow
yes there is
do all philosophers have an s in
them
yeah i think most of them do
does that mean selina jones is a philosopher
she could be
she sings about the
meaning of life
that's right
but i don't think she writes her own
material
maybe schopenhauer writes her material
burt bacharach writes is
there's no 's' in burt bacharach
or in hal david
who's hal david
he writes the lyrics
burt just writes the tunes
only
now he's married to carole bayer sager
this conversation isn't very good
we do have one today that's not on
the menu
it's a sort of
speciality of the house
live organ transplants
what's that
part v
mr bloke
don't worry dear
i'll get it
first man
er can we have your liver
my what
your liver
it's a large glandular organ in your
abdomen
you know it's a reddish-brown and it's sort of -
i know what it is
but i'm using it
second man
come on sir
don't muck us about
what's this then
a liver donor's card
need we say more
i can't give it to you now
it says 'in the event
of death'
no-one who has ever had their liver taken out by us has
survived
just lie there
it won't take a minute
mrs bloke
'ere
what's going on
he's donating his liver
madam
aarrgh
aaargh ow
ow
is this because he took out one of those silly cards
oooh
oohh
aargh aargh
typical of him
he goes down to the public library -
sees a few signs up
comes home all full of good intentions
he gives blood
he does cold research
all that sort of
thing
aaaagh
aaarghh
what d'you do with them all anyway
they all go to saving lives
aaaaargh
oh my god
that's what he used to say
it's all for the good of
the country
he used to say
aaaargh
d'you think it's all for the good of the country
uh
well i wouldn't know about that
we're just
doing our jobs
you know
owwwwweeeeeeeeeh
you're not doctors
blimey no
young man
i'm off out
i'll see you about
seven
son
look after yourself
aaargh
aaargh aargh
d'you er
fancy a cup of tea
that would be very nice
thank you very much madam
i thought she'd
never ask
you do realise
he has to be
dead
by the terms
of the card
before he donates his liver
well i told him that
but he never listens to me
silly man
i was wondering what you was thinking of doing
after that
will you stay on your own or
is
there someone else
on the horizon
i'm too old for that sort of thing
i'm past my prime
you're a very attractive woman
i'm certainly not thinking of
getting hitched up again
can we have your liver then
i don't want to die
it's perfectly natural
only take a couple
of minutes
i'd be scared
listen to this
man in pink evening dress
whenever life gets you down
mrs brown
and things seem hard or tough
and people are stupid obnoxious or daft
and you feel that you've had quite enough
just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
and revolving at 900 miles an hour
that's orbiting at 19 miles a second
so it's reckoned
a sun that is the source of all our power
the sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
are moving at a million miles a day
in an outer spiral arm
at 40
000 miles an hour
of the galaxy we call the milky way
our galaxy itself contains 100 billion stars
it's 100
000 light years side to side
it bulges in the middle
16
000 light years thick
but out by us its just 3
000 light years wide
we're 30
000 light years from galactic central point
we go round every 200 million years
and our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
in this amazing and expanding universe
the universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
in all of the directions it can whizz
as fast as it can go
at the speed of light you know
12 million miles a minute
and that's the fastest speed there
so remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
how amazingly unlikely is your birth
and pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
because there' bugger all down here on earth
makes you feel so sort of insignificant
doesn't it
yeah yeah
can we have your liver
you talked me into it
eric
chairman
which brings
us once again to the urgent realisation of just how much there
is still left to own
item 6 on the agenda
the meaning of
life
now harry
you've had some thoughts on this
i've had a team working on this over the
past few weeks
and what we've come up with can be reduced to
two fundamental concepts
people are not wearing
enough hats
matter is energy
in the universe there
are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive
some
energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person's
soul
however
this soul does not exist ab inito
as
orthodox christianity teaches
it has to be brought into
existence by a process of guided self-observation
this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability to be
distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia
max
what was that about hats again
people aren't wearing enough
is this true
edmund
certainly
hat sales have
increased
but not pari passu
as our research -
bert
when you say 'enough'
enough for what purpose
gunther
can i ask with reference to your second point
when you
say souls don't develop because people become distracted
has anyone noticed that building there before
gulp
the crimson
permanent assurance
a tale of piracy
on the high seas
of finance
london
england
in the bleak days of 1983
as england languished in the doldrums of
a ruinous monetarist policy
the good and loyal men of the
permanent assurance company
a once-proud family firm recently
fallen an hard times
strained under the yoke of their oppressive
new corporate management
pushed beyond the bounds of decent and reasonable victimisation -
the aged retainers take their destiny in their own hands and
mutiny
the crimson permanent assurance was launched upon the high
seas of international finance
there it lay
the prize they sought
the richest jewel in the
crown of the imf
a financial district swollen with multi-
nationals
conglomerates and fat
bloated merchant banks
hidden behind the faceless towering canyons of glass
the world of
high finance sat smug and self-satisfied as their future
in the
shape of their past
slipped silently through the streets -
returning to wreak a terrible revenge
adopting
adapting
and improving traditional business practices
the permanent assurance puts into motion an audacious and totally
unsuspected take over bid
heartened by their initial success
the desperate and
reasonably violent men of the permanent assurance battled on
until
as the sun set slowly in the west the outstanding return
on their bold business venture became apparent
the once proud
financial giants lay in ruins
their assets stripped
policies in tatters
it's fun charter an accountant
and sail the wide accountan-cy
to find
explore the funds offshore
and skirt the shoals of bankruptcy
it can be manly in insurance
we'll up your premium semi-annually
it's all tax-deductible
we're fairly incorruptible
sailing on the wide accountan-cy
they sailed off into the ledgers of history
one by one
the financial capitals of the world crumbling under the might of
their business acumen
or so it would have been
if certain
modern theories concerning the shape of the world had not proved to
be
disastrously wrong
part vi
the autumn years
not noel coward
good evening ladies and gentlemen
here's a little
number i tossed off recently in the caribbean
isn't it awfully nice to have a penis
isn't it frightfully good to have a dong
it's swell to have a stiffy
it's divine to own a dick
from the tiniest little tadger
to the world's biggest prick
so three cheers for your willy or john thomas
hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake
your piece of pork
your wife's best friend
your percy or your cock
you can wrap it up in ribbons
you can slip it in your sock
but don't take it out in public
or they will stick you in the dock
and you won't come back
oh what a frightfully witty song
oh shit
it's mr creosote
maitre d
ah good afternoon
and how are we today
mr creosote
better get a bucket
i'm going to throw up
gaston
a bucket for monsieur
merci gaston
i haven't finished
pardon
a thousand pardons monsieur

the jugged

truffles
anchovies
grand marnier
bacon and cream
there's still more

appetizers
moules marinieres
pate de foie gras
beluga caviar
eggs
benedictine
tart de poireaux
that's leek tart
frogs' legs
amandine or oeufs de caille richard shepherd
c'est a dire
little quails' eggs on a bed of pureed mushrooms
it's very
delicate
very subtle
i'll have the lot
a wise choice
monsieur
and now
how would you like it
served
all mixed up in a bucket
with the eggs on top
but of course
avec les oeufs frites
and don't skimp on the pate
oh monsieur i can assure you
just because it is mixed up
with all the other things we would not dream of giving you
less than the full amount
in fact i will personally make sure
you have a double helping
maintenant quelque chose a
boire
something to drink
six bottles of chateau latour '45 and a double
jeroboam of champagne
bon
and the usual brown ales
no wait a minute
i think i can only manage
six crates today
tut tut tut
i hope monsieur was not overdoing it last
d'accord
ah the new bucket and the cleaning woman
is there something wrong with the food
guest
the food was
excellent
perhaps you are not happy with the service
er no
no complaints
guest's wife
it's just we have to go
i'm having rather a
heavy period
have a train to catch
we have a train to catch
and i don't want
to start bleeding over the seats
perhaps we should ne going
very well
thank you so much
so nice to see
you and i hope very much we will see you again very soon
au
revoir
oh dear
i've trodden in monsieur's bucket
another bucket for monsieur
and perhaps a hose
companion
oh max
and finally
a wafer-thin mint
it's only a tiny little thin one
fuck off
i'm full
it's only wafer thin
i couldn't eat another thing
i'm absolutely
stuffed
bugger off
just
just one
oh all right
just the one
voila
bon appetit
the check
part vi b
maria
i sometimes wonder whether we'll ever
discover the meaning of it all working in a place like this
i've worked in worse places
philosophically
speaking
i used to work in the academie francaise
but it didn't do me any good at all
and i once worked in the library in the prado in madrid
but it didn't teach me nothing
i recall
and the library of congress
you'd have thought would hold
some key
but it didn't
and neither did the bodleian library
in the british museum i hoped to find some clue
i worked there from 9 till 6
read every volume through
but it didn't teach me nothing about life's mystery
i just kept getting older
and it got more difficult to see
until eventually me eyes went and me arthritis got bad
and so now i'm cleaning up in here
but i can't really be
sad
cause you see i feel that life's a game
you sometimes win or lose
and though i may be down right now
at least i don't work for jews
i'm so sorry
i had no idea we had a racist working
i apologise
most sincerely
where are
you going
i can explain
quel dommage
as for me
if you want to know what i think
i'll show
you something
come with me
i was saying that
this way
voice of maitre d
i can explain everything
don't be shy
mind the stairs
think this will help explain
over here
come
stay by me
nearly there now
you see that
that's where i was born
one day
when
i was a little boy
my mother she took me on her knee and she
said
'gaston
my son
the world is a beautiful place
must go into it
and love everyone
not hate people
you must
try and make everyone happy
and bring peace and contentment
everywhere you go
' and so
i became a waiter
it's not much of a philosophy
i know
but
fuck you
i can live my own life in my own
way if i want to
don't come following me
part vii
death
distraught male voice
i just can't go on
i'm not good any more
distraught female voice
what'll i do
i can't live
without him
distraught children's voices
mummy
daddy
more distraught voices

mr death
that's about all he says
there's
your drink
do sit down
we were just talking about some of the awful problems
facing the -
would you prefer white
i'm afraid we don't have any beer
jeremy
the stilton's awfully good
i am not of this world
well isn't that extraordinary
talking about death only five minutes ago
yes we were
whether death
is really
the end
as my husband
howard here
feels
or whether there is
and one so hates to use words like 'soul' or 'spirit'
but what other words can one use
exactly
you do not understand
ah no
obviously not
let me tell you something
just one moment
i would like to express on behalf of
everyone here
what a really unique experience this is
hear hear
we're so delighted that you dropped in
can i finish please
is there an after-life
if you could just wait please a moment
are you sure you wouldn't like some sherry
i'd like just to say at this time
can i just say this at this time
silence
i have come for you
you mean to
take you away
that is my purpose
well that's cast rather a gloom over the evening hasn't
it
i don't see it that way
geoff
let me tell you what i
think we're dealing with here
a potentially positive learning
experience
shut up you american
you always talk
americans
you talk and you talk and say 'let me tell you
something' and 'i just wanna say this'
well you're dead now
so shut up
all of us
now look here
you barge in here
quite uninvited
break
glasses and then announce quite casually that we're all dead
well i would remind you that you are a guest in this house
you englishmen
you're all so fucking
pompous and none of you have got any balls
can i ask you a question
how can we all have died at the same time
the salmon mousse
you didn't use tinned salmon did
i'm most dreadfully
embarrassed
the time has come
follow
follow me
testing
the fishmonger promised me he'd have some fresh salmon and
he's normally so reliable
can we bring our glasses
good idea
hey i didn't even eat the mousse
i'm so embarrassed
i mean to serve
salmon with botulism at a dinner party is social death
shall we take our cars
behold
paradise
i love it here
me too
receptionist
welcome to heaven
could you just
sign here
please sir
there's a table for you
through there in the restaurant
for the ladies
'after life mints'
happy christmas
oh is it christmas today
of course madam
it's christmas
every day

how about that
tony bennett
it's truly a real
honourable experience to be here this evening a very wonderful
and emotional moment for all of us
and i'd like to sing a
song for all of you
it's christmas in heaven
all the children sing
hark hark those church bells ring'
the snow falls from the sky
but it's nice and warm and everyone
looks smart and wears a tie
there's great films on tv

there's sony walkman headphones sets
and the latest video games
it's christmas it's christmas in heaven
hip hip hip hip hip hooray
every single day
is christmas day
lady presenter
that's the end of the film
here's the meaning of life
thank you brigitte
it's nothing
special
try and be nice to people
avoid eating fat
read a
good book every now and then
get some walking in and try and
live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds
and nations
here are some completely gratuitous
pictures of penises to annoy the censors and to hopefully
spark some sort of controversy which it seems is the only way
these days to get the jaded video-sated public off their
fucking arses and back in the sodding cinema
family
entertainment bollocks
what they want is filth
people doing
things to each other with chainsaws during tupperware parties
babysitters being stabbed with knitting needles by gay
presidential candidates
vigilante groups strangling chickens
armed bands of theatre critics exterminating mutant goats -
where's the fun in pictures
here's
the theme music
goodnight
